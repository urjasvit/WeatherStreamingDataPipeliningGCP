# Overview

This project puts forth an idea of engineering and processing the real-time incoming weather updates from all over the country and creating reports for further analyses. It proposes to use the various services provided by Google on their Cloud Platform to develop a streaming analytics solution that is secure, reliable and is easily scalable from the instant itâ€™s generated.

# Architecture Diagram and Implementation

Below is the architecture and data flow diagram that provides the overview of the implementation process to create a data engineering flow from fetching the data to analyzing it.
